# REQUIREMENT:
Client wat a tool that extracts GHIN scores for given number of players from https://www.ghin.com/.
Analyzes their performance relative to their handicap, and ranks them accordingly. The tool should provide a report in CSV, Excel, or PDF format.
Client what to set number of players and also date rage and 1 row empty after each record in csv if needed.
Client will enter GHIN ID in seperate csv which will be read by scrapper during process.
This required to login to the account.

# SOLUTION:
As client is non-techncial we used user friendly approach to operate.
Scrapper was developed using ui.vision (Selenium) Google Chrome add-on.
Basic idea will be, client will enter your ghin numbers in ghin-number-list.csv (check the csv format)

After client will open Google Chrome Browser and start pre installed add-on ui.vision
You will just click on play button and automation will start scrapping the data.
At the end it will be saved in another .csv file ghin-data.csv (check the csv format)

Whenever client want to scrap data for ghin numbers open the .csv and enter those new numbers and just start the player.
After you play the scraper you just wait and watch until process get done.

Every time, client will fill new GHIN numbers in .csv and play the automation at the end client will have data in new csv.

I have attached all the proof of work.
